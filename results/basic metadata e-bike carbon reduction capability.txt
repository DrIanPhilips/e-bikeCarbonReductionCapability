  "outlier_flag", A small number of LSOAs were difficult to model flagged ad TRUE, and the results here should be treated with more caution,                                       
"meanweightedkm_pp"  mean car km travelled per day accounting for car ownership gender and area type                                    
"mean_capability_daily_ebike_distance"  the physical capability to travel (max 1 hour morning and 1 hour evening)            
"mean_capability_daily_bike_distance"   the physical capability to travel (max 1 hour morning and 1 hour evening)
"mean_capability_daily_walk_distance"   the physical capability to travel (max 1 hour morning and 1 hour evening)                
"mean_ebike_co2_reduction_capability_per_pers_pa_Tonnes" mean carbon reduction capability per person pa by replacing car km with e-bike km per LSOA
"mean_car_km_replace_capability_by_ebike_per_pers_pa"   mean car km per person that can be replaced with e-bike km per LSOA

"WD21CD"       2021 Ward boundaries

"km_pp" km per person ( total var km in LSOA / ususal resident population calculated for 2011 during the MOT project).  see paper for refs to MOT project. 
"outlier_flag2" LSOAs where km_pp is greater than 50000.  These LSOAs should be treated with caution  - these LSOAs plus a few others hilighted in "outlier_flag" were more difficult to model - high mileages indicate for example presence of lease fleet operators.
