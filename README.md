# e-bikeCarbonReductionCapability


Code to accompany work by Ian Philips, Jillian Anable and Tim Chatterton estimating the capability of people to travel by e-bike, their ability to replace car travel with e-bike use and the capability to reduce car CO2 emissions.


As of March 2021 a journal article based on this work is in peer review, we have been revising the paper for reviewers so the project is work in progress.  We have made revisions to the code whilst revising the journal article. 


Many of the data sources are not openly available so the data is not provided here.

The folder example_capability_ebike contains code and dummy data allowing a minimal example to run.  

The folder example_capability_ebike also contains the distribution of Vehicle km travelled by trip length used in the simulation.
