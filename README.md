Many of the data sources are not openly available so the data is not provided here.  We have given a list of data sources in the paper.  Some of the data is available to researchers who register for access.  

The folder example_capability_ebike contains code and dummy data allowing a minimal example to run.  

The folder example_capability_ebike also contains the distribution of Vehicle km travelled by trip length used in the simulation.
